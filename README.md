# Spam-Bot
_**Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only!**_

This script if ran on a computer will allow the user to spam any chat. Once the script is ran you will click on any chat box and it will type the message that is being pulled from my text file. The counter is currently set to 50 times but can be modified.

Below is an example this when I spammed my own personal Slack chat:
