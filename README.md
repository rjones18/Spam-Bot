# Spam-Bot
_**Disclaimer: This code is for educational purposes only!**_

This script if ran on a computer will allow the user to spam any chat. Once the script is ran it will create a .txt file called `texts.txt`. This is able to be done by using the `subprocess` python library which allows you to run shell commands in your python script. After the .txt file is created, you can click on any box that you can type in text and it will type the message that is being pulled from the .txt file. The counter is currently set to 50 times but can be modified. This script can be used on Linux, Windows, and MAC.

Below is an example this when I spammed my own personal Slack chat:
